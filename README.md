Since a historical set of 2002-era CS225 lectures was made available on archive.org by Jason Zych in 2021, we think that the companion C++ lab code that went along with the Spring 2005 counterpart to those lectures should be made freely available too. An active link is [here](https://github.com/maxieds/ThrowingSomeOldBitsIntoAHoleOnGitHub/tree/master/HiMyNameIsLuckyHiLucky/codelibr).
