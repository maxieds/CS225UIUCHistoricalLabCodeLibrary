# CS 225 (Data Structures and Software Principles) @ UIUC -- Historical Lab Code Library

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxieds/CS225UIUCHistoricalLabCodeLibrary./main/repository-open-graph-template.png" />

Since a historical set of 2002-era CS225 lectures was made available on archive.org by Jason Zych in 2021, we think that the companion C++ lab code that went along with the Spring 2005 counterpart to those lectures should be made freely available too. 

To clone the repository, run the following ``bash`` terminal command:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/maxieds/CS225UIUCHistoricalLabCodeLibrary\..git
```
